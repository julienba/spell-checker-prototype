Here are a few ways to improve your prompt to ensure higher accuracy, better handling of edge cases (like punctuation), and strict adherence to the JSON format.

### Option 1: The Robust & Strict Version (Recommended)

This version adds constraints to prevent the AI from changing the author's style or tone, focusing strictly on objective errors. It also clarifies exactly how the output should look.

**Role:** You are a professional copy editor for a high-stakes business presentation.

**Task:** Proofread the provided text strictly for **spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors**. Do not alter the style, tone, or vocabulary unless it is grammatically incorrect.

**Output Format:**
Return the full text including the corrections. However, every time you make a correction, replace the original erroneous text with a JSON object using the format `{"origin": "original_text", "sugg": "suggestion"}`.

**Rules:**

1.  Keep correct text exactly as it is.
2.  If a phrase is grammatically incorrect, enclose the whole phrase in the "origin" field.
3.  Ensure the JSON is valid and properly escaped.
4.  Do not add conversational filler; output only the processed text.

**Example:**
*Input:* Their is a problem with the data.
*Output:* `{"origin": "Their", "sugg": "There"}` is a problem with the data.

**Input Text:**
{{text}}
